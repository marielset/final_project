----

Which option for the final project are you choosing -- 1, 2, or 3?
Project 2

IF YOU ARE CHOOSING OPTION 3, answer the following questions:

* Write 1-3 sentences summarizing what the goal of your project is:


* What are your two data sources? Provide links to documentation or websites you will be getting data from.


* Why are you proposing this project?


* What will the output of this project be? What will it look like, and what information will it contain?


* What are your concerns about this proposal?


-----

THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS ARE FOR EVERYONE. (Though they may be easier if you are choosing Option 1 or 2, because you can reference the Option 1 or 2 instructions.)

* What will at least one of the classes you're going to define be called?
I will have one class called movie


* What will that class take as input to its constructor?
self, and a dictionary that represents movie information


* What will 1 instance of this class represent?
each instance will represent one movie and the information about it


* What are 3 instance variables this class will have? What will they be called, and what information will they hold? Why are they important?
1- title will be the movie name. it will hold the name of the movie and will be important in order to access each movie as a seperate entitie
2- rating will be the IMDB rating. it will represent how accredited the movie is and will be important if I want to sort a list of movies in any meaningful way
3- budget will be the amount of money the production company spent making the movie. It will hold a digit amount and will be important if I want to categorize movies into low budget versus big budget films


* Explain 2 methods the class will have that are not the class constructor (__init__ method) by answering the following questions for each. 
ONE METHOD:
- What will the name of the method be?
__str__()

- What will the method do?
it will print the movie title and year it was made

- Will it take any additional input? 
only self

- Will it return anything? Should it change anything about the instance/an instance variable? 
it will not return anything and will not change any instance variables

- Why is it useful for this class definition, in this program?
it is useful to be able to print movies when I want and to see if two movies are the same


ANOTHER METHOD:
- What will the name of the method be?
actor()

- What will the method do?
find the list of actors in the movie instance

- Will it take any additional input? 
a number

- Will it return anything? Should it change anything about the instance/an instance variable? 
it will return the first __ actors in the actor list. it will not modify anything

- Why is it useful for this class definition, in this program?
when I am researching what actors are in the movie it will be helpful to have a method to easily return the first 5 actors instead of all of them

[If you definitely want to have a third, feel free to answer those questions a third time, because you'll have to do so eventually. when you write documentation!]


* What will the tables in your database be?
Tweets, Users, Movies


* What fields will each database table have? Which field of them is the primary key? You should list the fields for each database table here, e.g.
Tweets:
- Tweet text
- Tweet ID (primary key)
- The user who posted the tweet (reference to users table)
- The movie search this tweet came from (reference to the movies table)
- Number favorites
- Number retweets

User:
- User ID (primary key)
- User screen name
- Number of favorites that user has ever made

Movies:
- ID (primary key) 
- Title of the movie
- Director of the movie 
- Number of languages the movie has
- IMDB rating of the movie
- The top billed (first in the list) actor in the movie
- Budget



* List, in English, 2 queries you'll want to make from your database. At least one should be a JOIN. You can always change these later, but start with  ideas you're interested in and lessen the work on yourself later on! 
(e.g. from class examples, maybe "I want to make a query that accesses the numbers of times each user has favorited tweets, and the number of times tweets that user posted have been favorited -- so I'll be joining the Tweets table and the Users table")

select the tweet, amount of retweets, movie title and director from any tweet where the movie tweet equals the title and the tweet is retweeted more than 20 times. 
"Select Tweets.tweet Tweets.retweets Movies.title Movies.director FROM Tweets INNER JOIN Movies ON Tweets.movie = Movie.title WHERE Tweets.retweets > 20"

select all movies where the budget is greater than 20 million
"SELECT * FROM Movies WHERE budget > 20000000"

* What are at least 2 of the data processing mechanics you're planning to use? 
set comprehension, dictionary sorting

* Why will each of those be useful to you? What data might you use it on? 
(e.g. "Set comprehension: I think I'm going to be looking for unique names and proper nouns in this big set of text, so I'm going to use a set comprehension"). 
>>>This is especially important if you are doing Option 3, but it's important for everyone!<<<

set comprehension on the inner join to get tweets and the movies that they are about. if there are multiple tweets about a movie I only want one.

accumulate the list of all movies with the budget over 20 million dollars and sort them in order of rating


* What will your output look like? Will it be a .txt file? a CSV file? something else? What information will it contain? >>>This is especially important if you are doing Option 3, but it's important for everyone!<<<

output will be in a .txt file, giving people information on the different movies being most talked about in the media today.
